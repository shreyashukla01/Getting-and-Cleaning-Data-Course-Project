Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information


For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Code Book
The tidy dataset includes 180 rows and 68 colums so that avarage of "subject" and "activity" variables illustrate in a row of dataset. Hence, the dataset shows only the average (mean value) and standart deviation of these variables.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'trainandtest/timeAndFrequency.txt': A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

- 'trainandtest/subjects.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'trainandtest/activitylabel.txt': Descriptive Activity labels.

- 'trainandtest/avgData.csv': independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- 'trainandtest/combinedDataSet.txt' : Data set with time & Frequency variables, activity labels, subjects.

The following files are available for the trainandtest data. Their descriptions are equivalent.  

- 'trainandtest/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'trainandtest/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'trainandtest/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
